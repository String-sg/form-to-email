# form-to-email
Google App Script (JavaScript) to process form responses and provide conditional email feedback with basic HTML styling for emails sent

**Use case**
- After a major exam (e.g. Case Study for H2 and H1 Economics at JC level) where there are clear learning outcomes assigned by parts
- This will not work for essays or high-mark allocation without clearly tagged learning outcomes to particular questions given the sheer range of responses and errors possible (sorry H1 General Paper and English teachers for the essay component)
